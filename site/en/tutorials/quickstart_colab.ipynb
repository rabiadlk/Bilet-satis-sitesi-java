Why are they pertinent to the work programme topic?  Are they measurable and verifiable?  Are they realistically achievable?  What are the potential HEU partners ?  • Describe how your project goes beyond the state-of-the-art, and the extent the proposed work is ambitious. Indicate any exceptional ground-breaking R&I, novel concepts and approaches, new products, services or business and organisational models. Where relevant, illustrate the advance by referring to products and services already available on the market. Refer to any patent or publication search carried out.   Ambition beyond the state-of-the-art What are the state of the art for each and every objective and the partners output? •\tWhat are the current products/technologies/methods to solve the same/some of the problems that we are solving? On what products/technologies/methods are we building upon to improve the world? •\tWhat has been achieved in the research and implementation of the technology you are developing, and is relevant for this project? What challenges have been solved recently and we are using as a base for our engine? •\tThis description should reflect the entire market/research field, not only by the partners in this consortium. Any advancement in the technology due to a competitor? (one day a proposal would want to write how this project made a step-change in this technology, using our innovative approach) •\tUse a table listing all the products/technologies/methods you have identified, to discuss the differences between these solutions and compare them! (optional) Challenges •\tWhich are the problems affecting these existing solutions? Why can you not make it with the technology we have now? Why do you need so much development and cannot slightly modify something existing? •\tWhy is it difficult to design a system that can be easily adopted to this case? What causes it to be like that?  •\tWhy is it a challenge the objectives requirements? If anyone else can do that, but have shortcomings, why is it difficult to improve these shortcomings? •\tOther problems the other technologies showed in the state of the art have? •\tWhy are we doing the development listed in the state of the art??  •\tBe as specific and technical as possible, this chapter is addressed to the experts. Technical evaluators, from universities and industry will read this.  •\tPotentially add some Figure. •\t  Research & innovation maturity  What are the Innovative solutions - PROCESSES  What are the Innovative solutions – material or etc…..   Advances beyond the state of the art      -     Key Exploitable Results  KEY  must be defined for each objectives  KEY 1  KEY 2 Advance beyond State of the Art •\tHow is this project planning to address these challenges? •\tWhat technical advancements are we achieving?  •\tWhat parameters/characteristic/function are we improving? (e.g. energy efficiency, strength, performance, environmental benefits, vibration damping, time-to-operational?) •\tUse a table explaining for each of the parameters/characteristic/function what is the target (possibly numeric) or what is the expected result/behaviour of what you are developing. •\tGive plausible explanations of how you are going to do it, showing that you have not just created a wish-list, but these achievements are based on tangible proof that this is feasible. •\tBe as specific and technical as possible, this chapter is addressed to the experts. Technical evaluators, from universities and industry will read this.   • Describe where the proposed work is positioned in terms of R&I maturity (i.e. where it is situated in the spectrum from ‘idea to application’, or from ‘lab to market’). Where applicable, provide an indication of the Technology Readiness Level, if possible distinguishing the start and by the end of the project. Please bear in mind that advances beyond the state of the art must be interpreted in the light of the positioning of the project. Expectations will not be the same for RIAs at lower TRL, compared with Innovation Actions at high TRLs Innovation Potential •\tWhat effects does our innovation has on the technical aspect? What other advancements can be “unlocked” once our technology is deployed? •\tTo what extent can the knowledge/IP developed within this activity be applied to other applications within the field? •\tWhat other fields or sector could benefit of this innovation, which are currently outside the scope of this project as were not deemed relevant for us or not part of the call? •\tAre we enabling other improvement? Which? (E.g. as we are solving this high friction problem, it will be possible to use technology Y (something outside our scope), which was not applicable before, due to high temperature reached by the component)  Methodology  Overall methodology  The overall VITAL methodology is shown in Figure 4.  This approach will enable VITAL to deliver the project’s objectives, with Key Exploitable Results (KERs) and Expected Results (ERs) being achieved based on these.  • A KER is a main interesting result, selected and prioritised due to its high potential to be “exploited” to derive value chain benefits or as an important input to policy, further research or education.  • An ER is the outputs generated by VITAL of any form or nature which not directly protectable or exploitable. VITAL will achieve the following Key Exploitable Results.  KER-1: Three different manufacturing value chains for b-bTP processing.  • KER-1a A globally unique 3D printing process for b-bTPs (ObBJ-1.1).  • KER-1b A 3D foam printing flow prediction tool (OBJ-1.1).  • KER-1c A bead foaming process for b-bTPs based on rf heating (OBJ-1.2).  • KER-1d A FIM processing approach based on a Digital Twin with virtual AI control (OBJ-1.3).  KER-2: b-bTP blends with optimised carbon balance and high technical properties:  • KER-2a Flame retardant PLAs (OBJ-4.1).  • KER-2b Terpene 3-carene derived Polyamides (OBJ-4.2).  KER-3: Database of foamed b-bTP parameters (OBJ-5).  KER-4: A digitally optimised mechanical recycling approach for b-bTPs using a Digital Twin model. (OBJ-2&3). VITAL will achieve the following Expected Results.  ER-1: Industrially manufactured, b-bTP components that demonstrate lower environmental footprint, being sustainable, non-toxic and recyclable when compared to non-bio-based materials (OBJ-8).  ER-2: An adapted quality control approach for the b-bTP FIM production (OBJ-1.3).  ER-3 Life Cycle Analysis, Techno economic Analysis and Social Impact Analysis (OBJ-6).  ER-4 Circular/Sustainable by Design VITAL Business Models (OBJ-6). ER-5 A VITAL “Learning Factory” (OBJ-7). Three innovative process solutions will be developed based on 3 value chains:  Concepts, models and assumptions that underpin the work  What are the concept model of value chains ?   1.2.3 National and international research & innovation activities  What are HEU projects related with the call ?  1.2.4 Integration of inter-disciplinary approaches Whar are the inter diciplinary approaches fort he value chains ?    1.2.5 Integration of social sciences and humanities What are the  Social science within the Project will be aimed at creating more impact through citizens?    1.2.6 Gender dimension  1.2.7 Implementation of open science practices   1.2.8 Research data management  What are the  Research data management and management of other research outputs \n",
